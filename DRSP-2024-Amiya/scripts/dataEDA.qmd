Loading in libraries

```{r}
library(data.table) # this library contains the fread() function
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

Read in the dataset and name the columns

```{r}
data <- fread("data/docword.nytimes.txt.gz")

vocab <- fread("data/vocab.nytimes.txt")
```

Adding meaningful column names to the dataset

```{r}
colnames(data) <- c("article_id", "word_id", "word_occurrences")

data
```

Plotting the dataset as a bar plot

```{r}
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = word_id)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "NYTimes Word Counts",
       x = "Word ID",
       y = "Occurrences")
```

Identifying the word with the highest number of occurrences

```{r}
highest_occurrences <- data %>%
    ungroup %>%
    slice_max(word_occurrences) %>%
    pull(word_id)

highest_occurrences

print(vocab[highest_occurrences-1])
```

Finding the number of times that word occurred

```{r}
data_39677 <- (data[word_id == 39677, ])

sum(data_39677$word_occurrences)
```
